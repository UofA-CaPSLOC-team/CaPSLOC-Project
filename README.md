###Repository Notes


+ Due to potential issues with Windows not recognizing differently cased branch names as distinct, capital letters are henceforth ***banned*** from branch names. Please use all lowercase letters with underscores between words. (Example: my_branch_name)
+ Recommended branch names include the initials of the primary user of that branch, as well as the code area being worked on. (Example: jmp_motor_comtroller)
+ Please do not merge any branches other than testing with master. Following this policy will prevent merge conflicts on master, allowing it to be preserved as a pristine codebase.
